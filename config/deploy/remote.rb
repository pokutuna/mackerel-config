# Simple Role Syntax
# ==================
# Supports bulk-adding hosts to roles, the primary server in each group
# is considered to be the first unless any hosts have the primary
# property set.  Don't declare `role :all`, it's a meta role.

# role :app, %w{deploy@example.com}
# role :web, %w{deploy@example.com}
# role :db,  %w{deploy@example.com}
role :server, %w{deploy@pokutuna.com}

server 'pokutuna.com', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{server}
